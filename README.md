# ðŸ“— Project Overview
<hr>
<p>I read a lot of books but after I finish reading them I often don't remember all the most salient parts of the book. So I started taking notes. This project is built on this idea. The aim was to create a website where someone can store all the books they've read, their notes, ratings and when they were read. The books are sortable by rating, recency and title.</p>

<h2> Objectives </h2>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li> Integrate a public API to fetch book covers by their ISBN number. </li>
    <li> Gain more experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming. </li>
    <li> Demonstrate ability to Create Read Update and Delete data in a PostgreSQL Database to persist data.
    </li>
</ul>
